**HENRIETTA MARIA *HULTBERG* CRAWFORD, "Hettie"** was one of four children
born to John Oliver Hultberg and Helen Alarpakorak in the Bethel
district of Alaska, about 1908. Her mother was the daughter of Herman
Beaver and was born in Quinahok. Her father was a miner from Illinois and
after several years he left Alaska and lived the rest of his life in California. 

Helen later
married Karl Konig and in 1920 Hettie and her sister Freida were living
with their stepfather and Helenâ€™s Konig children in McGrath. Since
Hettie and Freida are listed with the last name Conrad, their mother may
have been married to a Conrad before Carl Konig. 

In McGrath Hettie met [**Leroy Crawford**](../_families/Crawford_Family.md) and they married and had three children: John, Helen
(Nagy) and Diane. The family moved from McGrath to Anchorage, Fairbanks,
and eventually Seldovia in about 1948. Leroy worked on fishing tenders
boats and later had his own machine shop. He died in Seward in 1973.

Hettie continued to live in Seldovia until her death on June 16, 1981.

She is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot \#531.
