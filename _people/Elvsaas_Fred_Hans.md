Fred was a lifelong commercial fisherman and a proud Alaska Native advocate. In his life, he served the public in many capacities but none that brought him as much pride as being President and CEO of the Seldovia Native Association Inc. from its founding until his retirement. He was a former CIRI board member, chief of police, school board member, Tribal Chief, City council member, federal subsistence council board member and chair of South Central Foundationâ€™s Traditional Healing Elders Council from 1999-2011. Elvsaas provided for his family starting in the early days of the crab fishing and at the family fish camp in upper Cook Inlet. He spent the best and worst days of his life at Kustatan and raised all of his children and grandchildren with his wife Gladys along the shores of Redoubt Bay in the summers.

He always longed to get back to Kustatan; it was his wishes that his ashes be laid to rest at Kustatan where he spent so many years surrounded by family and friends.
