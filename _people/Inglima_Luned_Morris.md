**LUNED DOLWIN *MORRIS* INGLIMA, "Lynn"**, the daughter of [**Richard and Luned Lewis Morris**](./Morris_Richard_C.md), was born April 30, 1926 in Seldovia, Alaska. Her parents were both Welsh and naturalized American citizens. They were proud of both their ancestry and their citizenship.  Lynn's brother, Dickie, was born in 1928 and soon after their cousin, Buddug, came from Wales to live with them. 

Lynn went to school in Seldovia through the 11th grade, but because the school was not accredited at that time, she travelled to Seattle on a cannery tender and spent her senior year of school there. She said that was a real eye-opener! She had never seen such things as elevators, for instance, that "outsiders" took for granted.  She graduated from Ballard High School and returned to Seldovia to help her folks in the store, and to work in the cannery.  

In the fall she attended University of Alaska in Fairbanks, and the following year she met a fellow student, [**Richard Inglima**](./Inglima_Richard.md). They were married in 1947.

The next few years were hectic, as they moved back and forth from Alaska to the "states" while Dick finished school and their family grew.  In 1954, Lynn's father was dying of cancer, so they moved back to Seldovia.  Dick was soon in the store full time and with five little ones, Lynn was pretty busy at home.  In her "spare time" she also worked in the store, keeping its old family name, "Morris & Morris". 

In 1966 the family left Seldovia.  They moved to Homer and purchased another store, which became "Inglimas". In 1976, with the children grown, they decided to sell the store and "retire". That involved gardening, fishing, hunting travelling to Hawaii every winter, and, most of all, spending time with her Alaskan family!

Lynn died April 5, 1992 in Homer, Alaska, and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #105, next to her husband.
