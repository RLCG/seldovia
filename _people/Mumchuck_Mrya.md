**Myra Pansy ANAHONAK Mumchuck** was born March 10, 1950, in Portlock, Alaska, to Alfred and Ann MOONIN Anahonak. 

Myra married Carl Mumchuck, son of Nick and Sophia Mumchuck of Port Graham. They raised one son, Charles, born in 1974.

Over the years, Myra held several different jobs including housekeeping, cooking and child care provider. She was very active in her Port Graham and Seldovia communities. She lived a subsistence lifestyle in both villages. She loved beading, knitting, and gathering with friends and family. She loved sharing home-cooked meals in her home and at "Gathering."

Carl died in 2003 and Myra continued to live in Seldovia. 

"She was always welcome and warm," her family recalled. "Myra loved caring for the needs of children. No matter what background a child came from, she made sure they were loved and cared for. She believed sharing customs and traditions with them would bring them closer to their past and give insight to caring for their community's future.

"Myra's final days were spent relying on God's will for her and her family. She knew the 'peace that passes all understanding' would come when he laid everything in place for them. 'Heal me, oh Lord, and I will be healed, save me and I will be saved, for thou art my praise' (Jer. 17:14) were her words of comfort every day."

She died on June 7, 2008 in Seldovia and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #315.  

She was survived by her beloved Peter Wilber; her son, [**Charles Mumchuck**](Mumchuck_Charles.md); brother, Matthew J. Anahonak of Bakersfield, Calif.; sisters, Anesia L. Metcalf of Port Graham, Kathy L. May of Anchorage; sister and "bro"-in-law, Patti and David McComak; sister, Gina West; brothers, Alfred A. Anahonak Jr., Victor Anahonak, Steve Anahonak; sisters, Elezabeth Laird, Margie Yost; and numerous cousins, nieces and nephews; and all of her "adopted babies" (you know who you are!).

Myra is preceded in death by her parents, Alfred Alex Anahonak Sr. and Ann Moonin, and husband, Carl Mumchuck.
