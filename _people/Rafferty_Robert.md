**ROBERT MONTROSE RAFFERTY** was born in St Louis Missouri in 1942 to Paul Hugh & Margaret I. (Griffaw)Rafferty. He lived his early years in Cape Girardeau, Missouri where he went through school, enlisted in the Army National Guard and married Kathleen M Braun.

In 1970 they packed the truck with children, the camper with food and a big trailer with furniture and headed up the Alcan highway to Alaska. To hear the story, there were not enough spare tires to be had for that trip, as their furniture was solid heavy stuff. They spent the summer in Nikiski where Kay's brother Fred Braun called home. That fall took the Rafferty family to Anchorage for the next 8 years, where son #3 was born.

Bob's employment ranged from retail sales, carpentry and working with the Anchorage Fire Dept. He headed to the north slope with the building of the Trans Alaska Pipeline in the mid-70s. Afterwards he came to Kenai again and worked at Fred Braun's Marina and Alaska Industrial Hardware. His love for the open ocean and fishing boats led him into commercial fishing for salmon & halibut in Cook Inlet. He took a boat to Kodiak and on the way home he spent a weekend in Seldovia's harbor. Bob fell hard for Kachemak Bay and made his home in Seldovia.

He married [**Annie COGGINS**](./Rafferty_Anna.md) in 2001, and they spent the rest of their lives content right there. He retired from Crowley, and with Annie ran their charter business "Alaska Paradise Charters" until 2018. Over the years Bob had 2 boats, the FV Brandy which went down off Anchor Point and his charter boat the Veronica Mae. Bob was truly a salty ole sea dog and was the happiest when out on the water being Captain. Finding the good fishing holes then taking people out to see what they could catch just made him happy. He enjoyed motoring around the many coves & bays all the while telling his never-ending tales and sharing Alaska's beauty with others.

Bob made friends easily and had many. He could join in discussions quickly especially if the subject of conversation revolved around fishing or firearms. Bob had a deep love, understanding and respect for all firearms. He soaked up history of the many different models of the early days. He spent hours cleaning his guns even if they were only handled momentarily. Bob was a master ammunition reloader and spent hours at the range perfecting his craft. He built great ammunition and shared that love and knowledge with many of us. Back in the day he shot bow & arrow competitively in Anchorage. He played a mean game of darts with friends in Kenai. Bob loved all things Nascar, baseball & football. He enjoyed having folks over to watch a game, maybe a fish fry and always a good visit.  Bob passed away Feb 15th, 2022, at home in Seldovia just 3 weeks after his wife Annie passed. He was 79.

Bob was predeceased by his parents, his wives Barbara Grove & Anne Coggins Rafferty. He was survived by his 4 children and their families. Shelly (Rick) McGahan, Jason (Debi) Rafferty, Todd (Phillis) Rafferty & Paul Shannon Rafferty. His sister Barbara Ann (Tom) Fitzgerald of Cape Girardeau, Mo along with many Braun, Rafferty, Fitzgerald, Griffaw & Ford family members.
