**Hannah Johanna HANSEN** was born Feb 12, 1877 in Bergen Norway. 

She married to **Henry Anderson** (born on February 5, 1866, in Flore, Norway). In the span of ten years, two sons and two daughters were born while they were living  in Bergen.

- Jacob Andreas“Jimmy” Anderson, born March 4, 1905
- Jessie Henriette Anderson, born May 10, 1902

Henry came to the US in 1910 and the rest of the family followed in 1912. They were living in Gray’s Harbor, Washington at the time of the 1920 US Census. Henry and Hannah divorced soon after. 

Hannah then married another Norwegian, [**Peder/Peter Pederson**](./Pederson_Peter_Emanuel.md) on Dec. 21, 1921 in Seattle, WA.  He had been fishing in Alaska since 1914 but was in Seattle at the time of his marriage and when he declared his intention to become a US citizen in 1924.

Peter brought the family to Seldovia in 1924 and Hannah’s son Jack soon took up his tug and barge business. 
Hannah received her US Naturalization papers in 1936 while living in Seldovia. At that time her son Jack was living in Seldovia, Jimmy in Los Angeles and Jessie (Sutton) in Seattle. Hannah (Bahr) may have died by then.

After Peter died in 1940 Hannah married [**Hilmar Olsen**](./Olsen_Hilmar.md) (born 1879 in Norway; died Aug. 11, 1959 in Seldovia.)

Hannah was taken ill in Seattle, Washington and after several days in the hospital, she too died, on September 13, 1959.  She was cremated  and her ashes remained in Seattle.
