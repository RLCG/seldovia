**Anna E COGGINS Rafferty** was born one of 11 children to Charles and Mattie Coggins on May 23rd, 1948 in West Point Mississippi. 
After graduation she saw a bit of the world eventually settling in Olympia, Wa. It was here she met and married **Gerald (Jerry) Wybenga**. They lived in Shelton and raised two children.

She created many happy memories for her children, from the crazy Halloween parties for all the kids in the neighborhood to feeding everyone one of her good meals just "because". The times she would take us kids to the Donut Tree for two donuts & cocoa before school will never be forgotten. The camping trips around western Washington with mom were something we looked forward to, knowing she would cook up some yummy southern meal. Mom enjoyed spoiling, and was always sure to treat her children fairly. At Christmas, she would count each gift, fruit, nuts, and candy to make sure one didn't get more than the other. She was always their biggest cheerleader.  The children also knew the morning rule: "Coffee first then we'll discuss the day."

Annie and Jerry later divorced and she moved on, settling in Kenai, Alaska. On a weekend getaway she visited Seldovia and never left. That is where she met the love of her life and her soul mate [**Bob Rafferty**](./Rafferty_Robert.md). They married and shared life together for over 20 years. When Bob retired, they purchased a fishing charter business that they ran successfully over 10 years. It was ironic in a way as Annie never liked boats nor navigating the boat ramps. Those two created many happy memories in Seldovia. The picnics at Red Mountain, and outings to the end of the road at Jakolof Bay as well as just sitting for hours watching the surf out at Outside Beach were her favorite ways to spend the day. The only thing better was to have treasured friends close and maybe a Bud Light in hand.

Annie worked hard her whole life giving her best at all that was thrown at her. She was honest, positive, stubborn, and full of joy. She made life a happier place for all who knew her.

Annie died in Homer on January 25, 2022.  Her husband, Bob, passed away in Seldovia, just three weeks later.  Her children are **Theresa (Brian) Naugle** of Montana and **Kenny (Kara) Wybenga** of Washington, and there are numerous grand and great grandchildren.
