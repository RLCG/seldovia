**David Hilts** the son of Rodney and Sunni Hilts, died on February 22, 1987 at sea.  

Andy Anderson describes the tragedy: 

On February 22, 1987, while setting king crab pots off of Augustine
Island in Kamashak Bay area, David was swept overboard by a rogue wave.
He was fishing on the 100-foot fishing vessel F/V *Alliance* and the
weather was inclement. The Alliance was a 100-foot king crab fishing
vessel, that regularly fished in that type of weather. The wave that
washed David overboard also damaged crab pots that were on the deck,
ripped a crab pot out of the launch rack from the hydraulic dogs locking
it down and washed another deckhand off his feet, pushing him under the
launch rack. The first sighting of David was when he was seen
approximately 100 yards off the starboard stern of the vessel. All
attempts to rescue him were unsuccessful. He disappeared beneath the
vesselâ€™s bow and was then seen sinking beneath the water. The Alliance
crew searched for many hours, returned to Seldovia and notified the
Coast Guard, which conducted a thorough search for several days. Later,
local residents continued the search, hoping to bring a sense of
closure. The family was given permission by the city of Seldovia to
erect a memorial in honor of David at the Outside Beach park. On a knoll
overlooking Kachemak Bay, Lower Cook Inlet, and the Kamashak Bay area,
they built a bench for all of us to go to pay our respects.
