**PEDER/PETER EMANUAL PEDERSON, "Pete"** was born February 5, 1876, in Skudenes, Norway to Emmanuel and Bertha Pederson.  He immigrated to the US in 1896, and arrived in NY at the age of eighteen. By 1918, he was 42 years old and living in Sand Point, Alaska working as a fisherman for Union Fish Company of Unga, Alaska. 

On December 21, 1921, Peter married **Hannah Johanna HANSEN Anderson**, born Feb 12, 1877 in Bergen Norway.  Hannah had previously been married to Henry Anderson. Henry Anderson was born on February 5, 1866, in Flore, Norway. Henry and Hannah had two sons and two daughters between 1899 and 1908. Henry and Hannah were divorced in 1920 and she married Peter Pederson Dec. 31, 1921 in Seattle, WA.  That is why the two sons listed with the Pedersons in Seldovia in 1930 have Anderson last names.  

Peder declared his intention to become a US citizen in 1924, when he and Hanna were living in Seattle. 

Pete's surname is sometimes misspelled as "Peterson" which can be confusing because there were Petersons and Pedersons living in the Kachemak Bay area at the time.

After Peter died in 1940 Hannah married [**Hilmar Olsen**](./Olsen_Hilmar.md) (born 1879 in Norway; died Aug. 11, 1959 in Seldovia.)
