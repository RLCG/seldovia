Former Alaska resident, Alyce Carlough, died at home on October 21, 2004 from complications related to Parkinson’s disease. She was well cared for during her illness by her devoted husband, Howard. Mrs. Carlough was born on May 16, 1920, in Seldovia, Alaska to Tollak and Lucille Ollestad. She graduated from Seldovia High School in 1938. She lived in Seldovia, Alaska from 1920 - 1961. She alternated residences between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and Washington for 31 years, of which she spent 10 years crab fishing with her husband. She resided in Washington thereafter. She loved the ocean and the outdoors. She was a graceful dancer, enjoyed music, singing, and playing the piano. Her favorite pastimes included playing bingo and black jack, reading about current events, crossword puzzles, and combing the beaches of Alaska for driftwood and artifacts. She loved all wildlife and flora. During her last years she enjoyed watching squirrels, birds, and other wildlife from her living room.

She is survived by her husband, **Howard Carlough** of Tumwater, WA. Howard and Alyce were devoted to each other and enjoyed living a very active and adventurous life together with family and friends. Together they befriended many and for them, the term “stranger” did not exist. They would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on December 18, 2004.

She will be greatly missed by her husband, children, and all her grandchildren whom she loved so dearly. She will be remembered for her independent and loving spirit, which was admired and revered by many. She loved and lived life to the fullest.
