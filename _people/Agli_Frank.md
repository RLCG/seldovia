**Franklin Robin Agli, "Frank"** was born on Oct. 7, 1939, in New York, N.Y., to Katherine Mooney and Silvio Agli. Frank served 20 years in the Air Force with assignments in Texas, Mississippi, California, Okinawa, Japan, New Jersey, King Salmon, Alaska, and Panama City, Fla. He was fluent in Japanese and was an entrepreneur, owning several businesses in Bristol Bay and Seldovia. 

Frank was a barber, air traffic controller, charter boat captain, bartender, commercial fisherman, airplane pilot, flight instructor, master wood artisan, carpenter, plumber, electrician, mechanic, sport fish guide, merchant marine officer, heavy equipment operator and gardener, and had the mind of an engineer – he could fix or build anything. 

Frank loved Alaska and became an avid hunter and fisher providing for his family. He had a great love for luxury cars, owning several Cadillacs and Toronados in his day. He also had an extensive model car collection. Frank was lovingly known as Dad, Pops, Poppa Frank, Grandpop Agli or Uncle Frank to family and friends. He was an animal lover, providing home to many dogs and cats over the years. Sheba, a lab-mix, was his faithful companion after the passing of his beloved wife [**MaryAnne**](./Agli_MaryAnne.md).

His family wrote: “Dad was wickedly intelligent and quick-witted. He had a wry sense of humor and had the biggest heart. He lived life to the fullest in all that he did, and he did a lot! We would often joke that Dad was going to outlive us all.
Dad loved his children and grandchildren dearly.”

Frank was survived by his sister, Nancy; brother, Paul; children, Frank Jr., John, Tom, Andria, Dwayne, Joel (Sonny), Juliana (Missy), Robert (Bobby), Jason and Michelle; as well as numerous grandchildren, greatgrandchildren, nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his father, Silvio; mother, Katherine; brother, Roger; and wife, Maryanne.

At the age of 82, Frank died on May 31, 2022, surrounded by family at South Peninsula Hospital in Homer, Alaska 

Family and friends gathered for a military service on Saturday, June 11, 2022, at 2 p.m., at Outside Beach in Seldovia, and in Bristol Bay and North Carolina to celebrate his life and spread his ashes.
