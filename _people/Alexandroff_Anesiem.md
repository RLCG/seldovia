**ANESIEM ALEXANDROFF** was born in Kodiak in March 1872. He lived on
Woody Island, Kodiak in 1900, with Otto Anderson, from Sweden as a
lodger. In 1910 he lived with his parents, John and Leuboff (?)
Alexandroff in Seldovia. In 1920 he and his wife Catherine were living
on Kachemak Bay and he was a fox farmer. He had 3 adopted children
including Andrew Beristoff. 

He married Agnes CLEMENLOFF Barnes April 12, 1931 in
Seldovia. He was listed as a rancher at the time and both he and Agnes had been married twice before. 

Anesiem drowned in Seldovia Bay on June 27, 1945 and is buried in Seldovia City Cemetery Plot #25.

The name Alexandroff is likely an outgrowth of the Russian name
Aleksandrov, which can also be seen as Alexandroff. Early Russians at
Kodiak and at Fort Ross had some version of this name and the
Alexandroffs were sometimes listed in US Census records as "Creole",
meaning of a Russian father and Alaska native woman. All of the men in
the photo below were considered [**"Creoles"**](../_resources/Seldovia_Russian_Creoles_In.md)
