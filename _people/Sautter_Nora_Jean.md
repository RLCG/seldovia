**Nora Jean SUTTON Geagel Sautter** was born June 20, 1937 in Lander, Wyoming to Edward and Flossie Sutton.

While born in Lander, WY, Nora spent most of her life in Alaska and Arizona. Nora adored the Alaska life — hunting, fishing, living remotely — and has declared the City of Seldovia, AK her favorite place on earth.

She married, first, Russell Howard Geagel and they lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado for many years. Their children include Russell, Lynn, Pam and Michael.

In 1991, Nora married Jack Sautter and they moved to Sun City West, Arizona and built a full life together enjoying their families; contributing to their community through dance club, golf leagues, neighborhood parties, church involvement; and loving one another. 

Nora went to heaven on February 28, 2020. She was 82 years old. Nora is survived by a large motley crew of a family who adored her. 

Nora shared her love of Jesus Christ, her family, books, and travel with her husband and her children. We know she “woke up with Jesus” that Friday, and we look forward to seeing her again in heaven. 

Nora is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery next to her grandson, [**Jordan Gaegel**](/Geagel_Jordan.md).
