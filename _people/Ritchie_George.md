**George Ritchie** is first listed in Alaska in 1910
census records where he is living on Yukon Island, with his parents, [**U.S. Ritchie**](./Ritchie_Ulyses_Grant.md) and Annie and his brothers, Sam and Jim.
All we know of Annie is that she was born in Alaska.
In 1920, only son George is listed with them.

George married **Mary Simeneoff** in 1923 and U.S. married **Mary Toco** in 1925. In 1930 and in 1940 census records both George and his father are listed in Seldovia as widowers; he is a carpenter and George is a fisherman. 

Near where the theater used to be, George built a two story house with lots of shingles and a round tower, where he could sun bathe on it. Not long after that, the BIA school was built right across the street and he didnâ€™t get to do much sun bathing (From Fred Elvsaas interview)
