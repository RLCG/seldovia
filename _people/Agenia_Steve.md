**STEFAN AGENIA, "STEVE"** was born about 1890 to **Stepan and Parascovia Agenia** somewhere on the Kenai Peninsula, perhaps in English Bay (now Nanwalek) or Port Graham. His family was living in Port Graham in 1910 and 1920.

By 1930, Steve was a salmon fisherman in Seldovia, partnering with Arthur Hendrickson, from Norway, with whom he also boarded.  

Steve died of pneumonia in Seldovia on June 8, 1938 and was buried that same day. He may have been buried in the lower cemetery and removed to Seldovia City Cemetery at the time of relocation.
