in Seldovia. He married Helen Nelson December 26, 1924 in Seldovia. His
death was as a result of tuberculosis.**

Fred Elvsaas remembers: *"Sergay, well Sergay -he was blind and they
lived up right next to where Perry used to lived, where the Beech is,
there were two houses built identical, they were two alike and they had
a boardwalk between them, they were basic, two of them houses, and
Sergay was blind, but he could build little boats with clock engines in
them, and he had bird nests he had cut through the wall, because his
mother cut these little holes and built these little bird nests in ’em,
had swallows and he had ’em in cages and all kinds of this stuff. He was
really a neat guy when I was a kid, he was probably about, you know,
thirty or forty years old-what’s it say here, he was twenty-nine in
’34"*
