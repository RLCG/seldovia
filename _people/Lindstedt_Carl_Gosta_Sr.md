**CARL GOSTA LINDSTEDT** was born in Stenby, Sweden on December 24, 1905 to Leander and Christina BACHMAN Lindstedt. He arrived at Ellis Island, NY February 14, 1925 and was listed as a farm laborer on his way to Seattle, Washington. He declared his oath to the US in 1926 in Seattle. 

He fished for cod in the Bering Sea before settling in Seldovia in the mid 1920's at the age of 19. He arrived from Seattle on the four-masted schooner, the *Alice Cook*. 

At that time, the floating processor the [***Salvator***](../_boats/Salvator_The.md) had been converted to a herring saltry.  He worked at the saltry, earning $80 a month, with 50 cents an hour overtime, and room and board as well. 

Carl married **Anna Esther PONCHENE** on December 2, 1929, in Seldovia. In 1930 he was still living in Seldovia but listed as single and living with fishing partners Carl Nordensen and Edward MacKenzie.  He was living in Seldovia in 1936 when he applied for US citizenship and received it in 1939. 

He served in the Territorial National Guard and at one time was the Seldovia harbormaster. He also served on the Seldovia City Council and as Mayor.

Carl married [**Daisy PHILLIPS Cameron/Froeshle/Henington**](Lindstedt_Daisy_Phillips.md) on March 29, 1946, in Seldovia. Their two children, Carl and John were born and raised in Seldovia. His grandson [**Carl Lindsted**](./Lindstedt_Carl_III.md) was born and died in Seldovia in 1970.

He loved to read, play cards and go moose hunting; many children in Seldovia knew him as "Grandpa."

Carl died in Homer, Alaska August 2, 1990 and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #536.  Daisy died in Seldovia on December 14, 1999.
