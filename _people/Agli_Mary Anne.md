**Mary Anne Agli** was born June 2, 1957 in Pendleton, Oregon to Gladys Brown and James Burke.

She was always a wild and free spirit who was full of spunk and sass. She was often the life of the party. Probably best known from her years as a bartender in Seldovia and as the Seldovia Harbormaster, she made friends from all over the world and all walks of life.

In her earlier years, MaryAnne was well known for dressing up as a Playboy bunny, eventually earning herself the nickname “Rabbit.” Some of her favorite things were gardening, walking the beach in search for beach glass, cheering for the New York Yankees and dressing up in fancy homemade hats for the Kentucky Derby. She was always up for a good joke or prank.

More than anything, she cherished her husband Frank and dog Sheba as well as her children, grandchildren and friends. She had a heart of gold and would do anything for anyone. Her spirit and selflessness will live on in all who knew her.

MaryAnne Agli, 61, died on July 17, 2018 in Anchorage after a month-long hospital stay.  Her husband [**Frank Agli**](./Agli_Frank.md) died May 31, 2022.

MaryAnne was preceded in death by her parents, Gladys and James; and her older brother, Rodney Bixler. 

She was survived by her husband, Frank, and dog, Sheba; older sisters Jody Coe and Becky Roberts; younger brother, Frank Morgan; daughter, Michelle; stepdaughters Andria, Missy, Poppy and Shiloh; stepsons Frank, Thomas, John, Dwayne, Sonny, Bobby and Jason; 27 grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.

A celebration of life was held on Saturday July 28, 2018 at Outside Beach in Seldovia, Alaska. In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made in MaryAnne’s name to the Homer Animal Shelter in Homer, Alaska.
