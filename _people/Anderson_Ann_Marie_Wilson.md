the Girlsâ€™ Card Night playing Snertz. 

"Ann was a beloved wife, mother,
grandmother, sister, aunt and loyal friend; a person who cherished
friendships and was eager to share with others. A beautiful person, both
inside and out which was only accented by her beautiful smile. She was
loved, not only by her family, but by an entire community. Through her
long illness she remained positive and tended to be concerned aout those
close to her even more than her own problems."
