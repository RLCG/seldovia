**GLADYS *SIMEONOFF* (OGLE) ELVSAAS** was born on May Day - May 1, 1917 in Kodiak to Eurena Simeonoff. She married first **Hoyt Burlington Ogle** and had children Boy Dexter and Leonard. When she married [**Fred Elvsaas**](./Elvsaas_Fred_Hans.md) the boys became his stepchildren and they had five more children including [**Ruth Ann Elvsaas Morgan**](./Morgan_Ruth_Ann_Elvsass.md) and [**Allen Hans Elvsaas**](./Elvsaas_Allen_Hans.md) who are buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery.

From Fred ELVSAAS: When Gladys was small, her father was from Kodiak and her mother was from Kenai, and if you saw Gladys’ real name you wouldn’t recognize it, it looks like a mis-type and it’s about this long, and it was shortened to Glafera and then to Gladys. Then when her father was killed in a (power craft) accident in the Kenai River, and I don’t know what happened to her mother, she went to the Baptist Mission in Kodiak and she was raised there. So ---she wasn’t there enough to---she was a young kid when she left, I would guess probably, you know, seven, eight years old, but she remembers some of Kodiak, but you know, like the old homes and all the dog teams and stuff like everybody had to have, but then when she left Kodiak her sister, Mary, was married to George Rist from here, and she came here, but she had she had several brothers too, and two of them drowned up here in the lagoon, it was a tragedy, and her brother, Freddy, died across the inlet on a boating accident, they were hauling fuel over to an Army base over there and the boat, I don’t know what happened, but the boat  sank and they-and Freddy Chimyonoff and Freddy Neiman, they both swam to shore, but they both froze on the beach. And it took a long time-but Bob Garr can tell you how he rescued them-he didn’t rescue them, they were dead, you know, he was on the crash boat, he never went there. 

Gladys died in Sedovia on February 17, 1996 and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 238.
