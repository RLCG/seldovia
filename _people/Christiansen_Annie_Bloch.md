A notice in the 2 Aug 1930 edition of The Fairbanks Daily News Miner
reads, "DOING WELL IN NORWAY - Julius Christiansen, a resident of Alaska
for many years, is now a successful fox rancher in Norway, according to
the Seldovia Herald. Christiansen formerly resided at Seldovia and left
the Territory six years ago to establish a fox ranch in his native land.
He made his start in Alaska foxes and writes that he is prospering."
