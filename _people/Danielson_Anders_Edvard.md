There is no record of any marriages or children.  He died in Seldovia July 17, 1945. 

*The first car brought to Seldovia was an old Dodge pickup.  It was owned by Ed Danielson and brought here in the 1930s.  He had to build the roads to drive it on. One of the roads is still existing today.  It is the one that runs from Main Street up past the hospital and Jack English’s office.* From: Jack  and Susan English interview, with students of Susan B. English School (1980)

Fred Elvsaas remembers *"When I was a kid we had coal for that school and the coal was brought over on a barge, and it was measured and brought up to the school. But at the time that I was in the school, there was a fellow by the name of Ed Danielson who had an old truck, well, I don’t know whether it was old but it was the only vehicle in Seldovia and he hauled coal off the beach up to homes and so forth, some people hauled their own, but if you were a ways from the beach Ed Danielson had his truck and he hauled it up to the school and people loaded it and off-loaded it.  He was an old man, he never drove, Fred Munson drove the vehicle for him."*

Ed  is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 154.
