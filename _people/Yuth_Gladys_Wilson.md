**Gladys WILSON Yuth** was born on July 17, 1944, in Seldovia to [**Tania Sorokovikoff**](./Wilson_Tania_Sorokovikoff.md) and Abraham Wilson.   

She was married September 30, 1961, to **Harry W. Yuth** who passed away in 1997. Having grown up in Seldovia, Gladys worked in the local cannery, set net fished with her husband and children, and worked in the local Post Office with Jack and Susan English.

Gladys had a strong faith in her Lord and Savior.  She was a loving, caring, amazing woman.  She had a heart of gold, always there for her family and friends through good and bad; she knew just exactly what to say and how to help us all.  Always with a smile on her face and positive about life, she will be greatly missed.
