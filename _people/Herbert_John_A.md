**John A. Herbert** was born in Illinois in July 1869.  His parents were both born in Canada and spoke French.  

In 1900 he was living in Homer, Alaska, working as a coal miner. The census records indicate that he came to Alaska in 1896.

1906 – began construction of a dock at Schooner Beach.  The pier that jutted 300 feet out from shore was t-shaped and allowed ocean steamers to tie up and offload.  The pilings for this pier were driven by hand with local native labor.  

In 1907 J.A. Herbert & Co. established a saltery in English Bay and operated it until 1910. There was no harbor there and it was sometimes dangerous to land and unload freight.

In 1910, John was living in Seldovia, as a single man.  Sometime before 1920 he turned his attention to blue fox farming and either purchased or rented property on Passage Island near Port Graham.  “This farm was established several years ago and has been fairly successful.  At the beginning of 1919 the stock consisted of 25 pairs.  These produced about 100 pups, but heavy losses occurred, as approximately 80 percent of the young were killed and carried away by eagles.  Only 23 pups reached maturity.  Twenty-seven foxes were sold for breeding purposes, 25 were killed for their pelts and 10 pairs were held as stock for 1920.  Salted fish heads were used as food for the animals.  These are easily obtained a the cannery of the Fidalgo Island Packing Co. at Port Graham.”  From US Bureau of Fisheries report 1919 

In the 1920 US Census John and wife Elizabeth and granddaughter, Dorothy Yantes, age 8, born in Washington were living in Seldovia and he was a fox farmer on a nearby island.

In the Cook Inlet country J. A. Herbert, of Seldovia, engaged for the first time this season in mild-cure operations. The fish came chiefly from 
two traps driven at favorable locations in Cook Inlet. *US Bureau of Fisheries Report, 1921*


According to documents in the ACC collection, John Herbert purchased buildings from the Alaska Commercial Company in Seldovia. He also helped people in Nanwalek purchase the ACC building there that became a part of the old Church building, a cornerstone of Nanwalek’s history. Today this building, the old Sts. Sergius and Herman of Valaam Church, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Many Elders in Nanwalek have confirmed that the building was bought for two sea otter pelts. Apparently, there were a few men in Nanwalek who worked for Herbert. These men told him that they wanted to buy the buildings that the ACC left behind, as by 1899, the ACC had closed down the store in Nanwalek for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, Herbert sent the following letter to the ACC offices on Kodiak. Please keep in mind, as with all historical documents, I kept the original spelling, grammar and capitalization of letters.

“Homer Nov. 3th 1901

From a letter dated 1902 December, we know that Herbert had purchased the Seldovia Buildings, but he did not mention the ones in Nanwalek.
