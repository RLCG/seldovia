**HILMAR OLSEN** was born in Namsos, Norway on February 14, 1879. In 1910 he was a seaman on a ship in
Shelikof Strait. He was living on Kachemak Bay by 1920 and was a fox and fur farmer then and in 1930 census as well. These census records indicate that he first immigrated to the United States about 1904 and applied for citizenship in 1914, but so far we haven't found any of those documents.

Hilmar never married until 1943 when he married [**Hanna Hansen Pedersen**](./Hansen_Hannah.md), widow of [**Peder Pedersen**](./Pederson_Peter_Emanuel.md) in
Seldovia on January 20, 1943.

From Elsa Pedersen's book "Kachemak Bay Years": Hilmer Olsen of Bradley
River, our first upper-bay friend after he had moved to Seldovia and
before we moved to Bear Cove, came to a tragic end. His wife grew
senile, and her son made arrangements for her to enter a nursing home
and for Hilmer to go to the Pioneer Home at Sitka. He was nearly blind
and would soon be helpless to care for himself. One day he put his old
squirrel-shooting rifle to his head and pulled the trigger. His neighbor
found Hilmer in his woodshed the next morning, still sitting upright,
his life ebbed."
