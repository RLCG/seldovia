**James Naismith Cleghorn** was born on November 22, 1852 in Lewiston,
New York to Naismith and Elizabeth Cleghorn. His father was born in
Scotland and his mother in Ireland.**

Information about James' earliest times in Alaska comes from Alaskan researcher, Colleen Mielke, in an online article 
[***Harry Mellish and James Cleghorn Pre Gold Rush Prospectors in Alaska***](http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~coleen/genealogy/mellish.html). The map below, hand-drawn by O.G. Herning and updated by Colleen, is also part of that article.

James came to Alaska in 1886. He and his partner, Harry Mellish
crossed the Yukon River near the Russian Mission Portae and went up the
Kuskokwim River in search of gold in 1890, long before the gold rush of 1897. Finding very little gold, the men spent the winter of 1890-91 in
the village of Kolmakov near the confluence of the Kuskokwim River and
the Holitna River.  
  
The next season, Mellish and Cleghorn searched the Mulchatna River area
but found only small quantities of super-fine gold. In 1892, the men
split up and Cleghorn went on to marry an Athabascan woman named Mary
Shitachka (Paul? Panfeelof?) of Tyonek in about 1893. (The 1900 census
in Susitna Station lists Mary as a member of the Tyonek Tribe but the
1910 U.S. Census for Ouzinkie, Spruce Island, lists her as
Athabascan--Kutchin Tribe, from Kantishna and date of birth May 1874.)

By 1896, James Cleghorn was the Alaska Commercial Company agent at
Susitna Station. In 1902 the original Postmaster ceded his position as
well as his trading company position to James Cleghorn. In 1910, the
family was living in Ouzinkie on Spruce Island near Kodiak and times
were tough. An article written in the San Francisco Call (newspaper) in
1912, said they had received word that the Cleghorns and their 12
children were trying to live on $25 a month. U.S. Treasury Secretary
Wayne McVeagh was so concerned that he offered the Cleghorns free
passage out of the area on a U.S. Revenue Cutter.

By 1920, the family was operating a fox farm on Yukon Island. James
Cleghorn and his wife are both buried in Seldovia’s Hillside Cemetery
below the Russian Orthodox Church.  (James 1852-1928) (Mary
1866-1932).
