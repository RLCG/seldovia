**RICHARD WILLIAM MILLER**, who always went by the name of "Dick", was
born in San Francisco California on May 2, 1908 to William Otis Miller
and Alma Amelia Hextrum Miller. He was the youngest of three brothers
and they were raised in Marin north of San Francisco.

Seldovia resident Mike Miller relates that when his dad was about 18
years old he made an agreement with his father. His father had some
property in La Honda, California and Dick promised that he would build
him a house if his father would send him to flying school. So Dick built
a house of redwood logs that is still standing and then he enrolled in Hancock Foundation College of Aeronautics, studying to become an airplane pilot. 

- **Hancock Foundation College of Aeronautics** opened on May 1, 1929 in Santa Maria, California. Ten-week classes were offered prospective pilot candidates, with successful individuals becoming licensed pilots. Graduation of the first students occurred in 1929. The college, patterned after the current army and navy schools with the same curriculum and semi-military discipline, hoped to become the “West Point of the Air”.  Tuition for the school would be nominal, but requirements would be stiff and discipline firm.  In trying to determine a fair tuition fee per student, the 52-year old Hancock learned that it cost the federal government at least $25,000 (including destroyed planes) to train a pilot. To make a real contribution to the advancement of aviation and to keep the tuition fees within the means of the average flying school candidate, Hancock realized that he had to keep costs low. The average cost to train and graduate a student pilot was $4,500.  This opening would make it the first non-profit making institution of its kind in the country. To give cadets a complete course in every branch of aviation, each room had a special purpose. The modeling room was used to teach the cadets to design and build an entire airplane. Wind tunnels were installed in another room, where a model plane and pilot would be subject to the most severe conditions that a plane might encounter. A third room was used solely for mechanics. The 6 a.m. rising bell had the cadets quickly dressing into olive drab uniforms to get ready for a day devoted to flying instructions and ground-school work, plus exercise, meals, study and recreation. When taps sounded at 10 each night, the cadets were more than ready to call it a day. When the initial class ended on May 1, 1929, some graduated with flying licenses, while many took the full transport course. Others, though, were dropped before the end of the year.  The next three years brought more rigid requirements, resulting in fewer graduates and more eliminations. At the close of the third year of operation, a junior college department was added to meet the demand of young high school graduates for a course that would allow them to take up flight training without further academic work in a college or university. However, since there were more graduate flyers than there were jobs available, Hancock was pressed to discontinue the training course until cadets could be assured of a way to make a living when they did graduate.

*“Well, here it is after bed check Sunday nite, in the study hall and I must look like I’ve gone through a young war.  What a hell of a week end I’ve spent.  Broke all previous records for studying.  I’ve ben at it from 1 pm Saturday til 3 am Sunday morning and from 8 Sunday til Monday at 12 o’clock working on one damned aerodynamic problem. Only took time out to eat and sit on the toilet to meditate.  Finally got it, though. That damned incentive sure keeps me working overtime.*

*Wot a life, wot a life.  Ya work like hell for something (all same A rating) and when you’ve finally got it, damned if you can ease down and take a rest.  Instead, you have to work twice as hard to keep the amend thing.  Don’t know the course to figure in our relative wind velocity, area of wing, center of pressure travel, aspect ratio, area of tail surfaces, thrust line angle of attack, angle of incidence, etc.  As these later are unknown quantities it is necessary to work each one out separately.  It is easily seen now that the next step is to find the down load on the tail surfaces in the opposed direction of rotation so as to gain equilibrium or dynamic stability.  Arithmetically, this can’t be done but by using a little trigonometry to fin your angles, I haven’t the slightest doubt but what you’ll have no trouble at all.  This problem is to be handed in tomorrow without fail.  I believe I’ve gone over it very thoroughly, now are there any questions?  You ask him a question and he’ll say “Pardon me but I believe I’ll digress from the subject somewhat and bring up a point that might be of some help to you when you et into the higher aerodynamics.” Where I’ll end up but it will either make a first class pilot out of me or I’ll be the nuttiest nut some nut house has ever seen.  The hell of it is that when I’m handed one of the high faluting problems, before I do anything at all I have get some textbooks on arithmetic and find out how to work decimals, fractions, etc.  When I get past that point in the problem I have to run and get books on transposing, geometry etc.  Then information on plotting different “moments” on graph paper.  When I finally get the god damned thing worked I’ve read every damned textbook in the school.*

*The prof will get up in class and explain a problem like this: “Now you see, to find the lower arm of the fuselage over the center of gravity you simply solve for x and transpose as in necessary. Then it is necessary..” Hell – you know, he turns out to be just about as useful as the motorcycle instruction book that Ott (brother) and I had when we were a hundred miles from nowhere and had a busted motor.  It said, “If motor will not start, take same to nearest Harley Davidson Motorcycle shop.”  But then its just a case of poop or get off the pot, and I manage to struggle along somehow.  They say that to work hard will keep you out of mischief but its hell when in a peaceful faming community like this there is no place to et into mischief for 100 miles in any direction.*


About that time [**Grace Gleason**](./Miller_Avery_Grace_Gleason.md) was arriving in California. She had been
born on December 18, 1907 in Box Elder, Utah and she was of Mormon
stock, although her family weren’t practicing Mormons. Her cousin had
come to California before her and had married Dick’s older brother, so
they invited Grace to stay with them. Grace worked as a long distance
telephone operator in San Rafael. She and Dick were married and lived in
the house he built in La Honda while he commuted to San Francisco for
work.

It was difficult to get any flying jobs during the Depression so Dick
and a friend went to work on the Oakland Bay Bridge,
and then the Golden Gate Bridge. He was on a barge under the Golden Gate
Bridge lifting some heavy steel that fell and crushed his toes.

So both he and his friend Ed quit and moved on to Seattle and got on a boat called
*The Discovery*. It was a mail boat that used to run out of Seward and
up Cook Inlet. They arrived in Seward in 1937, and were still not able
to find any flying jobs. But they did eventually get a job in Candle, on
the north side of the Seward Peninsula. There was quite a bit of gold
mining there and they got a job putting in access roads into the mines.
They worked one summer there and returned to California where they both
had families. The next summer Dick returned to Alaska and was finally
able to get a job flying out of Anchorage. He brought the family to
Anchorage and was based out of there from 1937 until 1945.

During that time he also taught flying lessons and taught almost 2,000
people to fly, including famous Denali bush pilot Don Sheldon.

In 1945, the year that Seldovia was incorporated as a "Second Class
City", it also saw its first airplane service: **Seldovia Air
Service** with owner Dick Miller piloting a 6-passenger, double wing Waco float plane. The plane was tethered to the Seldovia dock. Harry White, a
pilot living in Kenai asked Dick to fly his plane and base out of
Seldovia for the summer. The family moved to Seldovia and lived in the
old Beachcomber Hotel. Dick had the airplane on a running line right
down on the beach in front of the hotel. It was quite a busy operation
in those days because there were four salmon canneries and they were
always flying people in and out. There was no airfield in Seldovia but when Beluga Lake was created in Homer it became possible
for floatplane travel between Seldovia and Homer. In 1947, Dick and a
partner, Earl Herr, bought a plane from Arnold Air Service in Anchorage.
Later that year they sold it to Merrill Ward Henington. More than $4000
had been paid on the purchase price by Henington when, on January 30,
1948, the plane disappeared from its ramp on the shore of Seldovia
Harbor. Some time later a wing float, identified as from that type of
plane, was brought to Seldovia and it was reported that it had washed
ashore about 10 miles from Seldovia.

Dick flew Harry White’s plane for two seasons and then bought his own
plane – a Stinson, a big radial engine on floats. During his second
season with that plane he was hauling gasoline in 5 gallon Blazo boxes
up to Jakolof Bay. He landed and taxied up to the beach, and jumped out
to get someone to help him unload the gas. He was away from the plane
when it suddenly exploded and burned up immediately. After that Dick
flew for several years but never owned another plane. One of the planes
he flew was a Seabee Republic, an amphibious aircraft. Then Dick and
Carl Nordenson, who was a commercial fisherman and owned the Linwood Bar
at the time, bought a three-seater Tri-Pacer. Dick flew that plane back
and forth to Homer for $8 each way. Then Alaska Airlines came in and
dropped the price to $6 and that was the end of Dick’s flying. Flying
was really important to him, but by then he had come to love Seldovia
and just didn’t want to pack up and leave. Dick flew out of Seldovia
between 1945 and 1950.

Next Dick became a loft foreman for Al Villa at the Alaska Shellfish
Company. That fall he became Chief of Police for the City of Seldovia.
It wasn’t a great paying job for a family man so he supplemented by
being the winter watchman at Alaska Year Round Canneries (AYR). There
was a house on the premises where the family could live and eat food
left over in the commissary.

Grace worked in Tyndle Lipke’s dress shop and in Frank Raby’s store for
a number of years.

In 1956, Dick died of cancer and the family moved back to Mill Valley,
California. Grace returned to Alaska one summer with both children and
they all went to Kodiak and fished with Fleming Giles. She stayed in California until she died in 1979. 

Memorial stones for both Dick and Grace are in the Seldovia City Cemetery, plots #71 and #72.
