**LEROY FORREST, "Crickett"** was only 11 years old when he drowned in
Seldovia on July 3, 1948. His mother was Helen Skinner of Unga Island,
but he was living with his grandparents **Walter and Nellie
Arkhimandritov Hansen Forrest** in Seldovia at the time of his death.
Nellie was Cricket’s grandmother and she and Walter had been raising him
from an early age. In 1940 the family was living in Naknek, Alaska and
Leroy was listed as Walter’s "step grandson in-law". Helen was Nellie’s
daughter by her husband Charles Skinner. By 1930 Charles and Helen were
divorced and Helen and two of her younger sisters were living at the
Jesse Lee Home, an orphanage in Seward, Alaska.

Old-timers sometimes confuse this cemetery name with "**Jimminy
Cricket**" another Seldovia character, but Jimminy Cricket was an older
black man and locals have many colorful stories about him.
