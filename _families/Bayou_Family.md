There were **Bayou** families living in Seldovia before 1900. It is
likely that the original Russian Bayou came to Kodiak in the
19<sup>th</sup> century and married an Alaska Native woman, as their
descendants are sometimes listed as
[**Creoles**](../_resources/Seldovia_Russian_Creoles_In.md) in census records.

[**Wassilii Bayou**](../_people/Bayou_Wassilie.md) was born in 1873 in Alaska. Most census records claim
that both of his parents were born in Alaska. He and his wife, Christina
were living in Seldovia with 3 children and he was listed as a laborer.
In 1910, the family was in Ninilchik with 4 children and he was listed
as a shop keeper. In 1920 they were back in Kachemak Bay where he was a
logger at a pile camp. Christina died not long after that and Wassilii
married Eva Odoyiah Hunter on September 22, 1925. Wassilii
was a trapper in Seldovia at the time of the 1930 census. He died May
10, 1937 and is buried in Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot \# 91.

[**EVA Backoff**](../_people/Bayou_Eva_Hunter.md) b. 1882, d. 1937, first married 
[William Hunter](../_families/Hunter_Family.md). After Hunter's death she married Wassilii
Bayou and they were living in Seldovia with her children in 1930. She is
buried in Seldovia City Cemetery, next to Wassilii in Plot \#90.

[**Martha Gussoff Bayou**](../_people/Bayou_Martha_Gussoff.md) b. 1902, d. June 10, 1938; buried in Seldovia
City Cemetery. Martha was the daughter of Theodore "Fred" Gussoff who
lived in Seldovia in 1930 as a widower with a son Mike Gussoff. She
married **Alfred Wassilii Bayou** on March 28, 1919 in Kenai, Alaska.
Alfred may be a son of Wasillii. He was living in Seldovia in 1920.
Alfred and Martha had three sons, Paul, William and Philip. She is
buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot \#109. After her death,
Alfred first married [**Katie Toko**](../_people/Toko_Katie.md) and then **Dora Malchoff Anahonak**.
He is buried in Anchorage Memorial Cemetery.
