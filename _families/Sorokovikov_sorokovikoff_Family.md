# SOROKOVIKOV/SOROKOVIKOFF Family

The **Sorokovikov** family name came to Alaska from Irkutsk Russia. Ivan
(John) Sorokovikov, born in Irkutsk about 1766 was sent to the mouth of
the Nushagak River to establish and manage the Novo Aleksandrovski Post
of the Russian American Company. Colonial Chief Manager Hagemeister
mentioned Ivan’s many years of devoted service to the Company. After
establishing the post he was ordered to leave for Kodiak and work there
for the summer. He later returned to Sitka aboard the ship Autumn
Vessel. By the summer of 1823 he was back in Kodiak. Ivan and his wife,
Maria Antropovna, a Creole, had 8 children. In March 1828 he was the
commander of the Karluk, which transported furs, goods and supplies
between the Company’s Kodiak District posts. The Karluk was wrecked
during a storm late in 1829. In May 1830 Ivan was reassigned as a pilot
aboard the boat Bobr. At the end of January 1831 he dispatched a baidara
from Kodiak to the Alaska Peninsula with people bound for the
Novo-Alexsandrovskii post. The baidara was lost with all aboard,
including Ivan. The wreckage was found in Zhuravlev Bay. Wrangell
reports that *"Aboard had been 8 employees, 3 of their wives and 4 of
their children, and 12 Aleuts from various settlements. Sorokovikov
himself and sailor Ivan Kolmakov, son of manager of Novo-Aleksandrovsk
redoubt, Fedor Kolmakov, were among them. Also laments the loss of the
Aleuts who are so necessary for the company and whose numbers are
decreasing in the Kodiak district. Lists annual numbers of Aleut deaths
in the Kadiak district from 1825 through 1830. Wrangell intends to look
into the decline in Aleut population when he visits Kadiak this
summer."* Russian American Company, 30 April 1831

Relief measures to be taken for the families left by the company
employees who perished in the \[lost\] baidarka:  (1) the debts of the
deceased are not to be charged to their relatives, but erased from their
accounts; (2) their credit balances are to be used to benefit their
wives; (3) bonuses are to be paid out according to the appended list,
and Sorokovikov's wife, out of respect for her husband's useful service
and large family, is to receive 1 pound of flour per month for free and
is authorized to purchase 20 funts more. 

Stepan Ivanov Sorokov, son of Ivan and Mariia, b. 1824, d. 1865, married
Tatiana Kompkov. They lived on Kodiak Island and had at least 7 children
including Nikolai 1847. Reader Nikolai Stefanov was the Kenai-born son
of Deacon Stefan Ivanov Sorokovikov and Tatiana Ivanova Kompkova;
educated in a theological seminary in Eastern Siberia. He worked as a
song leader in Kenai from
1875-188730.

[**Konstantine (Conste) Sorokovikoff**](../_people/Sorokovikoff_Konstantine.md), b. January 24, 1871 in Kodiak
married Sarafina and had children Sarafina (1903), Nick (1905), and
Andrew (1908). He was a Dena'ina-speaking lay song leader who grew up in
Kenai and was in charge of a chapel in Seldovia in the 1920s and 1930s.
He accompanied the missionary Paul Shadura as an interpreter between
1908 and 1914. A phrase ("my own Indian song leader") casually uttered
by Shadura regarding this Creole-cultural broker reveals the level of
Constantine's entrenchment into Dena'ina culture. The US Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA) could not figure out how to categorize him in their
official rosters: on the one hand, Constantine was involved in local
subsistence activities, and on the other hand, he was performing chapel
services. As a result, in their 1934 roster of Seldovia residents, the
BIA labeled him as a "second priest of Seldovia". ![](../assets/images/SOROKOVIKOV/media/image1.jpeg)
