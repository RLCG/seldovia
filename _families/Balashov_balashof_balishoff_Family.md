# Balashov/Balashof/Balishoff FAMILY

**Balashov** is a town in Saratov Oblast, Russia, located on the Khopyor
River. It was known as the *village* of **Balashovo** since the end of
the 18th century. In 1780, it was granted town status and became known
as Balashov. It is likely that the original Russian Balashov who came to
Alaska was from this location. 

Vasilii Ksenofon't'ev Balashev or Balyshev, born about 1778 in the Tobol'sh Province of western Siberia, by the Irtysh River,  was a *meshchanin* (lower middle class) employee in the Russian American Company. He married an Alaskan native or Creole woman and had at least two children, Akulina (1820-1841) and Ioann Ivan (1817-1861).  Ivan married Nakaa Elena (1819-1860) who was a Kenaika (tanaina Indian from Nikolaevsk Redoubt. They had five known children and both died in Kenai.

Ivan's son, **Zakharii Balashoff** and his wife **Mariia** lived in Seldovia and the two Balashoff families that are listed in Seldovia in the 1900 census are from their family. Known children were Mikhail/Mikkel, b. 1875, Ioann (1877-1879), Deonisii (b. 1880), Semion (1883-1884), Elisaveta (married Adam Bloch) and Timofei (1889-1925)

There are 8 individuals interred in the Seldovia City Cemetery with the Balashof surname. Three of
them are infants. Adam Blochâ€™s 2<sup>nd</sup> wife [Elizabeth Balashoff Bloch Markle](../_people/Markle_Elizabeth_Bloch.md) is buried in the Seldovia
Hill Cemetery in the town. See more information about her in the Bloch
Family section.
